        <h1>Requirements Specifications</h1>
        <h3>Abstract api</h3>
        <p>From the api address determine your location on earth. Use a fetch request to do it.</p>
        <h3>weather map</h3>
        <p>use a fetch to get the weather forcast and the 5-day weather report. do not use the one call api code. learn
            to get the units in imperial units instead of metric.</p>
        <h3>Veu and promises</h3>
        <p>api must launch from Veu not from the main JavaScript. don't do Hadouken code. catch the error if api call
            fails.</p>
        <h3>Vue and the DOM</h3>
        <p>No Vanilla DOM manipulation techniques. only the document object inside the event handlers. Have a "loading"
            message while waiting for the data. Title in Large Header. Create a div to display the users lat and long,
            city, state, and country. only display the available data. current weather data is in its own div. must
            include</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Human readable date and time</li>
            <li>current temp in F</li>
            <li>Daily high and low temp</li>
            <li>Sky conditions</li>
            <li>Humidity and pressure in hPa</li>
        </ul>
        <p>New div for each of the 5 day/3 hour forcast. this will be 40 divs. same info as the current weather.</p>
        <p>Has to have a "likely" "unlikely" and a "neutral". start in neutral. clicking the div cycles between the states.
        adds a tally to number of each for each vote, always 40.</p>

        <div>
            <h1>Design</h1>
            <p>I need to get a div that is connected to Vue. create a div to display the city, state, country, and coordinates.
                Create data in vue. Create lat lon city state and country and set them all to undefined, so I can set them later.
                Add Created to Vue. Have a fetch call to get the lat, lon, city, state, and country and set them to the data.
                return the fetch to get the weather for the lat and lon you just got. add temp, high, low, humidity, and pressure
                to the data and set them to undefined. Get the data from the fetch and link them to their correspondence in the data.
                return the next fetch to get 5 day 3 hours. Create a div to display the weather. Create a for loop to go for all 40
                divs. Get the response list and set it to the data. Create methods in Vue. Create a toggle method to go between
                three different things. Do some class binding on the 40 divs that correspond to the three different options.
                Create a computed method to get the counts. one for likely, unlikely, and neutral.
            </p>


        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Implementation</h1>
            <p> This is going to be a relatively easy assignment. I know how to fetch but not how to have nested fetch calls.
                the Vue app is new, but it doesn't seem to complicated to learn. The life cycle of Vue is going to be interesting
                understand. I haven't dealt with class binding so that will be new but I don't think to hard. I also haven't done
                a toggle method either.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Testing and Debugging</h1>
            <p>the fetch to get the weather isn't working correctly ---- i some how forgot the Https:// </p>
            <p>I set the data to "" instead of undefined. It wouldn't load any of the data. </p>
            <p>When i click on the div to vote on it, the background color for all 40 divs change. ------ I forgot to add an id
            to each div so they were acting as one.</p>
            <p>The time was a little rough because it looked like it was in the clouds part of the list, but it was its own thing.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Deployment</h1>
            <p>
                I committed and pushed it back and I can see it!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Maintenance</h1>
            <p>
                Not a lot of maintenance. The link of the fetch could break. But other than that there really isn't much
                that could go wrong.
